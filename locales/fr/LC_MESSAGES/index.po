"The following instructions explain the generation of OpenPGP keys "
"directly on the Nitrokey with help of the GNU Privacy Assistant (GPA). "
"You won’t be able to create a backup of these keys. Thus, if you lose the"
" Nitrokey or it breaks you can not decrypt mails or use these keys "
"anymore. Please see `here <openpgp-outlook.html>`_ for a comparison of "
"the different methods to generate OpenPGP keys."

"You need to have GnuPG and GPA installed on your system. The newest "

"**Please do not use the backup checkbox**. This “backup” does only save "

"need one) and on the other hand you risk that someone else can get in "
"possession of your encryption key. The advantage of generating keys on-"
