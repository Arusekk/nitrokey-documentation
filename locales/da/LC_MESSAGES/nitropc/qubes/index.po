"During boot, the system will prompt you to enter the passphrase to "
"decrypt the hard disk. Enter the default passphrase \"12345678\". This "
"was changed on the 15.01.2024 so if \"12345678\" is not working try the "
"old default: \"PleaseChangeMe\" The system will then guide you through "
"the process of creating a user account. After that you should have "
"successfully booted the system and could already use it normally."
