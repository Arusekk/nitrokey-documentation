"Kill Switches, which erase all the phone's data when triggered, are very "
"risky in practice as they could be triggered unintentionally. Therefore, "
"the NitroPhone instead has the feature to automatically shut down and "
"restart when inactive for a set period of time. This puts the phone in a "
"secure state where all data is encrypted, no data is in RAM, and the "
"phone can only be unlocked with the legitimate PIN or password. To "
"enable, select: *Settings -> Security -> Auto reboot -> select the idle "
"time duration after which the phone should reboot*"

msgid "**Q:** Why is OEM unlocking enabled by default?"
msgstr ""

#: ../nitrophone/faq.rst:39
msgid ""
"The only real purpose of the OEM Unlocking setting is `anti-theft "
"protection <https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft>`__ which is not "
"implemented by GrapheneOS. OEM unlocking controls whether the device can "
"be unlocked via boot loader. In the later case all user data is wiped. If"
" OEM Unlocking is disabled, someone can still boot up in recovery mode, "
"enter the menu, wipe data, then boot the OS and enable OEM unlocking. "
"Therefore it doesn't really increase the security but `disabling it "
"<index.html>`_ reduces the potential physical attack surface."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Q:** Why do we offer to remove the microphones?"
msgstr ""

#: ../nitrophone/faq.rst:42
msgid ""
"GrapheneOS informs about active access to the sensors and offers a "
"transparent way to monitor the device. However, physical removal is the "
"only way to completely exclude possible misuse. Especially in the case of"
" a microphone, which allows continuous eavesdropping."
msgstr ""

#: ../nitrophone/faq.rst:45
msgid "**Q:** Why do we also offer to remove the gyroscope?"
msgstr ""

#: ../nitrophone/faq.rst:45
msgid ""
"A gyroscope is a sensor that detects the orientation of a smartphone. It "
"not only stabilises the camera, but also tells the smartphone whether it "
"is held in portrait or landscape mode. Additionally the gyroscope can "
"also pick up mechanical vibrations, so it has the functionality of a "
"microphone."
msgstr ""

#: ../nitrophone/faq.rst:48
msgid "**Q:** Why don't we offer to remove the speakers?"
msgstr ""

#: ../nitrophone/faq.rst:48
msgid ""
"Microphones are usually used to convert mechanical vibrations into "
"electrical signals. The mechanical construction of loudspeakers is "
"essentially the same as that of microphones, so that loudspeakers can "
"also be used as microphones. In loudspeakers, electrical signals cause "
"the diaphragm to vibrate, thus generating sound. Conversely, this process"
" can be used to transmit the electrical signal from the diaphragm to the "
"device, as with a microphone. However, this method is not possible if an "
"amplifier is installed, as this does not allow the signal to be "
"transmitted from the loudspeaker to the device. All Nitrophones only have"
" speakers with built-in amplifiers and are therefore harmless."
